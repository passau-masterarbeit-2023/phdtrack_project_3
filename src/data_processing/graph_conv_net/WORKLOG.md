# GCN subproject

Goal: ML for KeyNode detection > We want to learn a model using a Graph Convolution Network on our annotated graphs.

## Logs

### Tue 8 Aug 2023

Re-starting to work on GNC project to get us back into the masterarbeit.

* [ ] INSTALL CUDA, for PyTorch...
* [ ] Update Conda environment
* [ ] Use a library to convert the graphviz graph into a GNC
* [ ] Learn the GNC
* [ ] Test it
