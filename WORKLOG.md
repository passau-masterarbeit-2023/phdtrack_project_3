# Worklog

### Fri 13th 2023

Started to look at raw data using Okteta, which is a hex viewer to view the data. Install on Fedora with `sudo yum install okteta`. I have tried to see if I could locate the keys manually using Okteta without success.

* [ ] How to find the keys in Okteta?
* [ ] How to search the HEAP_START? I can't find it in Okteta?
* [ ] How to create a dataset from the given data files?
* [ ] Where are the `-key.log` files necessary for training? Do we need to adapt the code to works with the provided `.json` files instead?

### Thu 12th 2023

Finished baseline of heavy refactoring. Original code working in both DEPLOY and non DEPLOY mode.

* [ ] Use and modify `train_classifier` to work with different classifiers. Continue to work on the testzone.

### Wed 11th 2023

Restarted to work on PhDTrack project. Reread documents and research materials. Continuing to work on code refactoring.
